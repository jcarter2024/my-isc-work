Data management:

we need to be able to reuse our collected data, share it, re-analyse it and compare it. 
ASCII gotchas
some text processers will embellish the words to make it more readable but this will not translate well in ASCII
To combat this save as in pure ASCII form

moving between linux and windows also creates differences, i.e ^M at the end of lines (there are linux programs to remove this)
ASCII generally lacks structure and is not recomended for data storage

CSV (comma seperated value) can be opened in spreadsheets and helps to structure the data.
BADC-CSV (British Atmospheric Data Centre)
includes metadata conventions for order
CSV does not contain white spaces

CSV gotchas
non ASCII characters will not format well
data and time formats differ

CSV is a good structure for 1D

Multidimensional data? Use netCDF
NEtCDF is binary stored not ASCII, it is not human readable


METADATA:
WHo produced it
How was it done
Why was it done
When was it made
Where does it relate to
What are the data
