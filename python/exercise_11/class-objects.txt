Object oriented programming

an object can be interrogated for example a string and its methods.
We can build our own class:

Class Fileanalyser(object):
    "a class above the rest"

when the class is first created it will call an init
def __init__(self, path):
    somefunc to initialise

def max(self) <-- access the data created in init
    return max(self.data)

if were repeating code for example if this then this bla bla we should use a class
