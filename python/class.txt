We wish to manipulate the weather data file
We want to split the columns 
We can use a dictionary to have a key (column head) associated with a list of values measured.
We can use the split function list.split("seperator") to assign the result to a variable.
the result is a list of strings where we can use each list element to assign a key.
col.strip() takes the white space off both sides
an example is:
col = [col.split() for col in header.split(".")]

or otherwise 

for col in header.split(bla):
	col.append(col.strip())

We can write a funcion to remove white space and reuse it:

def strip(line):
	vALUES = []
      for value in line.split()
	values.append bla
	
return values 

then call the function later on 

Now we want to read the data:
for line in reader (shorthand)
	data = strip(line)

set up dictionary :

for col in col_names:
data[col] = []

to use from script

if __name__ = "__main__":
args = sys.argv[1:]
for arg in args:
print('reading from terminal')
