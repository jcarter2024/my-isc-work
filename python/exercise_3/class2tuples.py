#a list is mutable but tuples are immutable. This means it is a list that cannot be changed after creation.
#create using normal brackets, when slicing we still use []. Sometimes we can use it without the brackets too
#single item tuples must have an appended comma i.e. bla = (5,)
#we can return miltiple items as tuples

#tuples can take general values i.e. a= [(1,3) , (2,3)]
					#for (a,b) in a bla
#enumerate forces out the index
