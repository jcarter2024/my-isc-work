#we can define functions

#def bla():
    #return 'bla bla bla'

#we can give them parameters

#def greet(name):
    #answer = 'hello ' + name
    #return answer

#temp = doctor
#result = greet(temp)

#we can use directly
# can return at any time and multiple times

#every function returns something, even without an else statement (none error)

#we can also define defaults with a second variable
#we can assign a function to a variable i.e t = myfunc()
#we can also list functons and apply with a for loop
#functions inside functions is also fine
#we can use *args in the function argument to not limit the number
