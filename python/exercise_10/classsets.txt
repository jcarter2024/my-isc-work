Sets are another type of collecgion
we can ask questions like the intersection of sets
i.e which sites have wind and temp data

sets are muteable s = {a, b, c}
s.add(13)
s.clear()

we can find unique items in a collection by finding characters in a word and adding to a set, it will only add duplicate letters once

we can check for sub or supersets >=
union a | b 
intersection a & b
difference a-b
symmetric difference a ^ b

DICTIONARIES

A collection of keys and pairs
keys are immutable and unique
stored in order of entry
this = {'bla' : key , 'blabla' : key2}
retrieve by putting in key []

print this[bla] = key
suppose a new key blugh we can assign it valuewrong, if we reassign valuecorrect it will overwrite and delete valuewrong

we can use key 'in' dictionary to see if its in

some useful methods: .keys and .values will print each
.setdefault adds a key of it doesn't exist and leaves it alone if it dos

items(dictionary) returns all the pairs in tuples
