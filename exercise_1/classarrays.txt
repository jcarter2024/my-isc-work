An array is like a list but with same type elements and can be multidimensional 
NumPy is the standard package for dealing with arrays.
import numpy as np
we can np.array a list to convert it 
we can optionally set the data type
dtype= np.int32

We can also create arrays in other ways:
np.zeros((3, 2), dtype = optional)
np.arange(10)

array indexing:
similar to lists, for example a[1] gives second element
we can slice as a[1:8]
for multidimensional arrays:
a[row, col] we can still use : interchangeably 
gedit 

rank = np.dim(a)
np.size(a) = elements
shape np.shape(a)

we can multiply element by element with two matrices a and b with a*b

we can test inside an earray 
answer = a > 5 this does an element by element comparison 
use np.logical_and(a >3, a < 5)
or np.logical_not

np.where(condition, a*2, 0) so when true do a*2 or when false do 0


a masked array may have bad values 
mask is always the same shape as the array

a=MA.masked_array
MA.masked_where(condition, data)
condition = np.logical_bla
